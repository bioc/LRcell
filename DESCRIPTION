Description: This package leverages marker genes information from single-cell 
    RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) to infer cell-type specific enrichment from bulk 
    RNA-seq datasets. The output statistics give users new insights of which 
    cell type(s) may be highly involved in the bulk experiments without deconvolution.
